Buckwalter
==========

A small python script that transliterates Arabic text using the Buckwalter Transliteration Scheme. It allows for multiple decisions to be made around whether or not to include all types of diacritics and characters or ignore them. Useful for NLP experiments where you may want to normalize text.
